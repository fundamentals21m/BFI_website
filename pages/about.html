    <h2>Professional Background</h2>

    <p>
      Brian's career spans actuarial science, quantitative finance, and enterprise risk management. His journey through the financial industry reads like a Forrest Gump-like adventure through major companies and the collapses of significant financial systems.

    <h2>The Bitcoin Journey</h2>

    <p>
      Discovering Bitcoin was one more step in Brian's financial journey, but it was the step that fundamentally changed his perspective on value, money, and institutions. Two years of intensive Bitcoin study led him to see clearly what was valuable and what was not in traditional finance.
    </p>

    <div class="callout callout-info">
      <div class="callout-title">From the Prologue</div>
      <p>
        "Bitcoin doesn't write books, but it enables people to see value more clearly for themselves, particularly when it comes to what a person spends their scarce time on. Understanding what in the world comes from work and energy, as opposed to the stroke of someone's pen or from printed money, helps people clarify what has true value."
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Why This Book</h2>

    <p>
      Many writers in the Bitcoin space say things like "I didn't write this book, Bitcoin did." Brian is clear that he wrote this book, not Bitcoin. However, Bitcoin made it possible in ways that don't have better words to describe.
    </p>

    <p>
      After building something of great value (which forms the basis for many strategies in Part 3), Brian found he couldn't agree with his employer on how to spend his time. They parted ways. Six months later, the idea for this book emerged, and within days he had thousands of words and knew it would be written.
    </p>

    <div class="callout callout-success">
      <div class="callout-title">The Mission</div>
      <p>
        "This is my wish for people, no matter where they are in life - that Bitcoin gives them the clarity of vision to find the most productive and valuable next-step actions to take."
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Beyond the Book</h2>

    <p>
      Brian is also a podcaster, continuing to find mediums through which to express himself and share his unique experience at the intersection of traditional finance and Bitcoin.
